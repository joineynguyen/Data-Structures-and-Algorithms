Hello and welcome to my "Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms" repo.

I understand this repo is not traditional by not involving projects.

My goal is to fully understand the concept of certain data structures and algorithms in order to implement them from scratch and or solve 
problems using these techniques with ease.

Here, you can inspect my code quality, documentation, and track my progress.

Each code file will contain my solution to problems that can be found in the 'Cracking the Coding Interview" book or from the website "LeetCode.com".

Below are lists of what I am or will master in.
**I will be adding in-depth documentation for each code solution in the near future. For now, most solutions contain only the problem's description.**

Data Structures:
- Linked Lists
- Trees, Tries & Graphs
- Stacks & Queues
- Heaps
- Vectors / ArrayLists
- Hash Tables

Algorithms:
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Concepts 
- Bit Manipulation
- Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Big Time & Space
